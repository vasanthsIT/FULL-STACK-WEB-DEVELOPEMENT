Git and GITHUB
Git is a popular version control system.
It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.
Git is not the same as GitHub.
GitHub makes tools that use Git.
GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.
In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.
